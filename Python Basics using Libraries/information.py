"""          Data Processing
--Its a data mining technic
--What ever we have some unstructure 
data that unstructure we convert into structure format
--The whole processing we are calling Data Processing.

STEPS-

1. Data Processing packages we have to import in our program.
2. We have to import unstructure data file (Data set)[we may get from
   from your local machine/internet/sklearn]--->datasets
3. We have to understand dataset
4. Find the missing values
5. We have to clean the missing data from your dataset.
6. Work on categorical values.
7. We have to find suitable machine learning model based on data.
8. Find the independent(x), dependent features(y)
9. Split the independent, dependent features into train 
   and test set
10. Then apply the machine learning model  
11. Predict the dependent values using known 
    independent features
12. If you are getting proper predictions then we can say, 
    that ML is suitable.
13. Plot the picture.
